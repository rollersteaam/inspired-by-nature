This selection is made at random, but biased by the amount of pheromone on the choices ahead (e.g. if an ant is placed at position S and bin 1 has a pheromone value of 0.5, bin 2 has a pheromone value of 0.8 and bin 3 has a pheromone value of 0.1, the ant should have a 5/14 chance of selecting bin 1, an 8/14 chance of selecting bin 2, and a 1/14 chance of selecting bin 3). This should be repeated for all k variables and b bins. There is no local heuristic for this implementation.
